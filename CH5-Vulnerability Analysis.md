## Vulnerability Assessment Concepts
### What is Vulnerability Assessment?
> A vulnerability assessment is
> an in-depth examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and controls, to withstand exploitation. 

> It scans networks for known security weaknesses, and recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and communication channels. 
> It identifies, quantifies, and ranks possible vulnerabilities to threats in a system. 
> Additionally, it assists security professionals in securing the network by identifying security loopholes or vulnerabilities in the current security mechanism before attackers can exploit them.

- A vulnerability assessment may be used to: 
    - Identify weaknesses that could be exploited(評估已知的漏洞) 
    - Predict the effectiveness of additional security measures in protecting information resources from attack(弱點掃描)


## Vulnerability Scoring Systems and Databases
1. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 
2. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 
3. National Vulnerability Database (NVD) 
4. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

### 1. CVSS v3.0 Ratings
> Common Vulnerability Scoring System(CVSS)
> is a published standard that provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities.

| Severity | Base Score |
| -------- | ---------- |
| None     | 0.0        |
| Low      | 0.1-3.9    |
| Medium   | 4.0-6.9    |
| High     | 7.0-8.9    |
| Critical | 9.0-10.0   |

### 2. CVE
> Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE)
> is a publicly available and free-to-use list or dictionary of standardized identifiers for common software vulnerabilities and exposures. 
- 認證機構：CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs)

### 3. CWE
> Common Weakness Enumeration(CWE)
> is a category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses. 
- 程式上有安全漏洞
- 認證機構：National Cybersecurity FFRDC

## Vulnerability-Management Life Cycle
### Pre-Assessment Phase 
> The pre-assessment phase 
> is a preparatory phase, which involves defining policies and standards, clarifying the scope of the assessment, designing appropriate information protection procedures, and identifying and prioritizing critical assets to create a good baseline for vulnerability management.

### Post Assessment Phase
1. Identify Assets and Create a Baselone
2. Vulnerability Scan
3. Risk Assessnent
4. Remediation
5. Vertification
6. Monitoring

## Vulnerability Classification and Assessment Types
### Vulnerability Classification
1. Misconfiguration(人為設定失誤)
2. Default Installations(人為設定失誤)
3. Buffer Overflows
4. Unpatched Servers(人為設定失誤)
5. Design Flaws
6. Operating System Flaws
7. Application Flaws
8. Open Services(人為設定失誤)
9. Default Passwords(人為設定失誤)

### Types of Vulnerability Assessment
1. Active Assessment
2. Passive Assessment
3. External Assessment
4. Internal Assessment
5. Host-based Assessment
6. Network-based Assessment
7. Application Assessment
8. Database Assessment
9. Wireless Network Assessment
10. Distributed Assessment (分散設備)
11. Credentialed Assessment (有登入)
12. Non-Credentialed Assessment (沒登入)
13. Manual Assessment (手動檢測)
14. Automated Assessment (自動檢測)

## Vulnerability Assessment Solutions and Tools
### Comparing Approaches to Vulnerability Assessment
> 四種弱點掃描的方案
1. Product-Based Solutions
    > 產品型->買設備來評估
    - Installed in the organization's internal network
    - private or non-routable space
    - detect outside attacks 
2. Service-Based Solutions
    > 服務型->找第三方幫忙
    - Offered by third parties
    - inside the network
    - network from outside 
3. Tree-Based Assessment
    > 策略型掃描->自己來針對不同的服務來自己掃描評估
     - The auditor selects different strategies for each machine or component of the information system 
4. Inference-Based Assessment
    > 推論型掃描->掃描首先建立機器上發現的協議清單。找到協議後，掃描過程開始檢測哪些端口連接到服務，例如電子郵件服務器、Web 服務器或數據庫服務器。找到服務後，它會選擇每台機器上的漏洞並開始只執行那些相關的測試。

:::

1. Host-Based Vulnerability
    - OS running on a particaular host computer
2. Depth AssessmentTools
    - 深度評估工具 用於發現和識別系統中以前未知的漏洞
    - unknown vulnerabilityies in a system
3. Application-LayerVulnerability Assessment Tools
    - 針對應用層
    - 應用層漏洞評估工具 旨在滿足各種操作系統類型和應用程序的需求
    - directed toward web servers or databases
4. Scope AssessmentTools
    - 範圍評估工具 通過測試應用程序和操作系統中的漏洞來提供安全評估
    - security to the IT system
5. Active and Passive Tools
    - 主動掃描程序對消耗網路資源的網路功能執行漏洞檢查
    - consume resources on the network
    - observe system data and perform data processing

   
6. **Location and Data Examination Tools**
    - Networked-based Snanner (掃實機的)
        > Network-based scanners 
        > are those that interact only with the real machine where they reside and give the report to the same machine after scanning.

    - Agent-based Snanner (裝在一台機器上 可掃同個網路的機器)
        >  Agent-based scanners 
        >  reside on a single machine but can scan several machines on the same network.

    - Proxy Snanner (可以在網路上掃任何機器的Networked-based Scanner)
        >  Proxy scanners 
        >  are the network-based scanners that can scan networks from any machine on the network.
    - Cluster Snanner (一次掃多個Proxy的Scanner)
        >  Cluster scanners 
        >  are similar to proxy scanners, but they can simultaneously perform two or more scans on different machines in the network.
